## Pyroboard

```python
from pyroboard import transform_dict, TreeHandler, TreeMenu
from pyrogram import Client

bot = Client(...)

handler = TreeHandler(transform_dict(
    {
        TreeMenu("Main", "main", "Hello!"): {
            TreeMenu("About me", "about_me", "I'm just a bot!"),
            TreeMenu("Thoughts", "thoughts",
                     "I'm a bot, I cannot think properly...")
        }
    }
))

handler.setup(bot)
bot.run()
```

**Pyroboard** is an intuitive framework for creating jointly with [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram) [Telegram](https://telegram.org) [bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

### Examples

In order to make use of the proposed examples, you need to create your own environment file by renaming [sample.env](./examples/sample.env) into `.env` and editing all the necessary variables.

   - [Calendar](./examples/calendar.py) - Get what day of the week a day is by simply choosing a year, a month and a day while discovering the potential of Pyroboard page menus.
   - [Sample](./examples/sample.py) - Interact with inline menus while understanding how Pyroboard works.
